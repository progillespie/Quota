Generate descriptives and trends to support Milk Quota analysis. 
Part of 3rd paper for PhD. 
=====

Uses datamarket version of data (for convenience). Should be checked against data sourced from Eurostat directly.

master file is named, 
   
   investigate_1984.R

Subroutines in ./subscript              (just plotting instructions. Datamarket dataset ID's used in filenames)
Custom functions in ./functions         (wrappers for importing and plotting called in subroutines)


Written using Rstudio, which is also handling Git. 

I don't think this should matter for the underlying R code.
